# E-Commerce MVP on Internet Computer Protocol

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of an e-commerce platform built using Azle, React, and JavaScript to be deployed on the Internet Computer Protocol. The MVP aims to demonstrate core functionalities of an e-commerce platform including product management, user management, shopping cart and checkout.

## Features
The MVP includes the following core functionalities:
- **Product Management**: Allows administrators to add, edit, and remove products, and users to view product details and search/filter products.
- **User Management**: Enables users to register, login, update their profile, and view their order history.
- **Shopping Cart**: Provides users with the ability to add/remove items to/from their cart, update item quantities, and view the cart summary.
- **Checkout**: Facilitates secure payment processing and order confirmation.

## Technologies Used
- **Azle**: Frontend framework specifically designed for building applications on the Internet Computer Protocol.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Internet Computer Protocol**: A blockchain-based decentralized computing platform that serves as the backend infrastructure.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for frontend logic and interactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard markup and styling languages for building web interfaces.
